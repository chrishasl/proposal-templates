# About

### About this Repository 
* This Github repository ([`proposal-templates`](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-templates)) contains proposal templates
* Anyone can create a template here 
* Two example templates, `simple.md` and `[detailed.md](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-templates/blob/master/detailed.md)` are provided for reference and use. 

### About this Document
* This document ([`README.md`](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-templates/blob/master/README.md)) provides general information about templates and proposals.  Step-by-step guids on how to create a template for the community and how to use a template for your own proposal are also given
* The templates provided here are just that, templates; customize sections in your project as you see fit

### About Templates
* Each template should have both **Description** and **Example** subsections in each section. 
  * These are included for reference in the template
  * The **Description** and **Example** headings should be ommitted in your proposal
* The process of creating a proposal using one of these templates is described below

### About Proposls
* Proposals typically need at least a scope, budget, and schedule to be considered complete
* A good proposal is structured, concise, and informative
 * if your proposal is too long and/or unstructured masternodes won't read it, and may simply vote no (or abstain from voting)
 * if your proposal lacks sufficient information masternodes won't know what you are providing, or they may feel it would be impossible to hold you accountable, and may simply vote no (or abstain from voting)
