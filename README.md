# About

### About this Repository 
* This Github repository ([`proposal-templates`](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-templates)) contains proposal templates
* Anyone can create a template here 
* Two example templates, `simple.md` and `[detailed.md](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-templates/blob/master/detailed.md)` are provided for reference and use. 

### About this Document
* This document ([`README.md`](https://github.com/dashcommunity/proposal-templates/blob/master/README.md)) provides general information about proposals and templates.  Step-by-step guides on how to create a template for the community and how to use a template for your own proposal are shown below


### About Proposls
* Proposals typically need at least a scope, a schedule, and a budget to be considered complete
 * Scopes are ideally broken down into key deliverables (*what* you are providing)
 * Schdules are ideally broken down into milestones for later progress reporting (*when* will you provide the deliverables)
 * Budgets are ideally broken down into itemized costs (*how* much does each item cost, comprising your total budget)
* A good proposal is structured, concise, and informative
 * if your proposal is too long and/or unstructured masternodes won't read it, and may simply vote no (or abstain from voting)
 * if your proposal lacks sufficient information masternodes won't know what you are providing, or they may feel it would be impossible to hold you accountable, and may simply vote no (or abstain from voting)

### About Templates
* The templates provided here are just that, templates; customize sections in your project as you see fit
* Each main section of a template has (or should have in the case of creating a template) both a **Description** and an **Example** subsection 
  * These are included for reference in the template
  * The **Description** and **Example** headings should be ommitted in your proposal, replaced by your own section content
* The process of creating a proposal using one of these templates is described below
