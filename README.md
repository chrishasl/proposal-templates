##### About Proposls
* Proposals typically need at least a **scope**, a **schedule**, and a **budget** to be considered complete
  * **Scopes** are ideally broken down into key deliverables 
    * answers the question: *what* you are providing
  * **Schdules** are ideally broken down into milestones for later progress reporting
    * answers the question: *when* will you provide the deliverables
  * **Budgets** are ideally broken down into itemized costs 
    * answers the question: *how* much does each item cost, comprising your total budget
* A good proposal is **structured**, **concise**, and **informative**
  * if your proposal is too long and/or unstructured, MNOs: 
    * may not even read it,
    * may have trouble understanding it,
    * may simply vote no (or abstain from voting)
  * if your proposal lacks sufficient information, MNOs:
    * won't know what you are providing, 
    * may feel it would be impossible to hold you accountable,
    * may simply vote no (or abstain from voting)

##### About Templates
* The templates provided here are just that, templates; customize sections in your project as you see fit
* Each main section of a template has (should have) both a **Description** and an **Example** subsection 
  * These sections are included for reference in the template
    * The headings should be ommitted in your proposal
    * The content should be replaced by your own
* The process of creating a proposal using one of these templates is described below
