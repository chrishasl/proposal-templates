### Schedule

###### Description
This section answers the question *when will you complete key milestones*, in narrative form.  

Milestones should be described here such that you can refer to them (e.g. by name) in the section below.  Decribe the relationship between milestones: what depends on what and whom.  You should be able to provide **specific dates** for deliverables under your (or your firm's) exclusive control.  Some tasks require input (e.g. separate deliverables) from third parties.  Although a properly planned and managed project will generally be able to deliver specific dates *even with* third parties, it is sometimes more appropriate to communicate **relative dates** in such cases.

##### Milestones

###### Description
This section provides a reasonable project schedule.  Estimate dates based on best available data.  Anticipate potential issues and provide assumptions/comments to  and manage personal and third-party expectations.  Milestones may or may not correspond one-to-one with deliverables.
